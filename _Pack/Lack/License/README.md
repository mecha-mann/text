This is the updated VTF Lack. Now she gives you the opportunity to compose in Cyrillic, Greek and Latin. She is a brave, contemporary and experimental typeface and comes in a single weight with its Italic. It works well as a display typeface, but is also designed to perform in all kind of texts sizes. Some crazy surprises are hidden into 3 differents stylistics sets!

VTFLack was originally created by Adrien Midzic in 2013 and distribuated by Velvetyne Type Foundry. In 2016 he begins to rework the font in order for it can be used for several graphic domains and not only for experimental creations.
In this update, inspired by the original lowercases, the legibility is optimized.

Now the Lackâ€™s emblematic set with its crazy uppercases is available in two stylistic sets called O.V.N.I-1 and O.V.N.I-2.
Another set named "Alternate" has also been created, in which alternative forms for some tiny ones are available.
